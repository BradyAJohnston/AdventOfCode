```{julia}
# Read the file into an array of lines
lines = readlines("2024/data/day_1.txt")
split_lines = [parse.(Int, split(line)) for line in lines]

col1 = [x[1] for x in split_lines]
col2 = [x[2] for x in split_lines]

sort!(col1)
sort!(col2)

total = 0
for i in 1:length(col1)
    total += abs(col1[i] - col2[i])
end
